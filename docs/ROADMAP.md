# Roadmap

## Near-term priorities

1. Guided Prep wizard: richer multi-step flow with validation and generated prep checklist output.
2. Campaign timeline: milestone, chapter, and unresolved-hook tracking.
3. Progressive prep planner: map campaign goals to session-level actionable tasks.
4. Print queue batching: multiple cards per page with robust pagination and overflow handling.
5. Print template enhancements: alternate card sizes, denser stat layouts, and optional GM-only annotations.
6. Creature intake improvements: manual key-stat extraction assistant and quality checks.
7. Optional AoN URL workflow: URL capture + future parse hook scaffolding.
8. Optional cloud sync: export snapshots to Drive while preserving local-first operation.

## Mid-term ideas

- NPC cards and initiative sheets
- Encounter packet generation from session scenes
- Rule reference snippets and condition quick cards

## Long-term possibilities

- Collaborative prep sharing (local file handoff first, online later)
- Theme packs for print aesthetics
